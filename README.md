# llmwiki

**You can't keep 30 projects in your head. Neither can your AI coding assistant.**

Every developer hits a cognitive wall. You switch from the billing API to the notification service and spend 20 minutes re-reading code just to remember how it's wired together. You onboard onto a client's codebase and the architecture lives in someone's head — or worse, in a stale Confluence page from 2022. Your AI pair programmer starts every session blind, re-discovering the same project structure you explained yesterday.

`llmwiki` fixes this. It scans your project directories and generates a persistent, LLM-maintained markdown knowledge base that compounds over time. Every project gets a structured wiki entry with architecture diagrams, API documentation, integration maps, and cross-references — written by an LLM that actually reads your code, not by a developer who "will document it later."

Inspired by [Karpathy's LLM Wiki pattern](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1908184210424959371). Plain markdown files. No database. No SaaS. Browsable in any editor. Injectable into AI coding sessions. Version-controlled with git.

## The Problem

You manage multiple projects across multiple clients. Each project has its own stack, its own services, its own integration points. You context-switch between them daily. The knowledge you need is scattered across READMEs that were last updated when the project was bootstrapped, docker-compose files that hint at the architecture, and tribal knowledge that lives in Slack threads.

Your AI coding assistant starts every conversation from zero — it reads the files you point it at but has no understanding of the broader system, the other services, or why things are structured the way they are.

**What if every project had a living, always-current technical wiki — and your AI assistant could read it before writing a single line of code?**

## What llmwiki Generates

One command scans a project and produces a comprehensive wiki entry:

```bash
llmwiki ingest ~/workspace/my-api
```

The output is a structured markdown file with:
- **Domain & Architecture** — what the project does, how it's structured, key design decisions
- **Service map** — every microservice with its purpose, tech stack, and responsibilities
- **Mermaid diagrams** — system architecture flowcharts and entity-relationship diagrams, rendered in GitHub/Obsidian
- **API documentation** — endpoints extracted from swagger/openapi specs
- **Integration map** — databases, message queues, external APIs with protocols and auth methods
- **Configuration reference** — environment variables, feature flags, runtime modes
- **Auto-generated tags** — technologies and patterns in YAML front matter (`go, grpc, event-driven, kubernetes, ...`)

For clients with multiple projects, `llmwiki` generates **executive summaries** with C4 system landscape diagrams showing how everything fits together.

Every wiki file is cross-linked — mention a service name and it becomes a clickable reference to that service's wiki page.

## How It Works

### Core Pipeline

```mermaid

    subgraph Scan
        A[Project Directory] --> B[Scanner]
        B --> |README, go.mod,\nDockerfile, .proto,\nswagger specs...|C[Scan Summary]
    end

    subgraph Detect

        D --> |single service|E[One wiki file]
        D --> |multi-service|F[One file per service\n+ project index]
    end

        G --> H[LLM]
        H --> I[Structured Markdown\n+ YAML Front Matter]
    end

    subgraph Write
        I --> J[Wiki Files]
        J --> K[Cross-Link]
        K --> L[Update Index]
    end

    subgraph Use
        L --> M[llmwiki context\n→ inject into CLAUDE.md]
        L --> N[llmwiki query\n→ ask across projects]
        L --> O[Browse in\nObsidian / editor]
    end
```

### With Graymatter Memory

When `memory_enabled: true`, [graymatter](https://github.com/angelnicolasc/graymatter) adds a persistent memory layer. Knowledge compounds across ingestion runs — the LLM sees what it learned before, cross-project patterns surface automatically, and the `query` command gets semantic search instead of brute-force file walking.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph Ingest ["llmwiki ingest"]
        A[Scanner] --> B[Scan Summary]
        B --> C[Build Prompt]
        GM[(graymatter\nmemory)] --> |"Recall:\nprevious facts,\ncross-project\npatterns"|C
        C --> D[LLM]
        D --> E[Wiki Files]
        E --> |"Remember:\nextract & store\natomic facts"|GM
    end

    subgraph Context ["llmwiki context"]
        F[Wiki Sections] --> G[Output]
        GM --> |"Recall:\ncross-project\nknowledge"|G
        G --> H[Inject into\nCLAUDE.md]
    end

    subgraph Query ["llmwiki query"]
        I[Wiki Walk] --> J[Combined\nContext]
        GM --> |"Recall:\nsemantic search\nacross all facts"|J
        J --> K[LLM]
        K --> L[Answer]
    end

    subgraph Docs ["llmwiki docs"]
        M[Scan + Wiki\n+ Existing Doc] --> N[Build Prompt]
        GM --> |"Recall:\nfull project\nhistory"|N
        N --> O[LLM]
        O --> P[Updated\nREADME.md]
    end
```

**Memory stores facts at two levels:**
- **Per-project** (`llmwiki/project/{name}`) — architecture, integrations, tech stack, service topology
- **Per-customer** (`llmwiki/customer/{name}`) — shared infrastructure, cross-project patterns, technology standards

Facts decay over time (30-day half-life) and consolidate in the background. Embedding search uses whatever's available: Ollama → OpenAI → Anthropic → keyword-only fallback.

## Install

Builds are published for macOS (arm64, amd64) and Linux (amd64, arm64).

**One-liner (recommended)**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/emgiezet/llmwiki/main/install.sh | sh
```
Installs the latest release to `~/.local/bin/llmwiki`. If that directory isn't on your `$PATH`, the installer prints the exact `export PATH=…` line to add.

**Pinned version**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/emgiezet/llmwiki/main/install.sh | VERSION=v0.5.0 sh
```

**Custom install directory**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/emgiezet/llmwiki/main/install.sh | INSTALL_DIR=/usr/local/bin sh
```

**Manual download** — grab `llmwiki_<version>_<os>_<arch>.tar.gz` from the [Releases page](https://github.com/emgiezet/llmwiki/releases), verify the SHA256 against `checksums.txt`, extract, and move `llmwiki` into your `$PATH`.

**Go users**
```bash
go install github.com/emgiezet/llmwiki@latest
```

### Updating

`llmwiki` checks GitHub once every 24 hours (cached, non-blocking) and prints a one-line notice on stderr when a newer release exists:
```
llmwiki 0.5.1 available (you have 0.5.0) — run 'llmwiki update' to install.
```

Run `llmwiki update` to upgrade. The subcommand detects how the binary was installed and re-runs the installer script for release binaries, or `go install` for Go-managed installs. Supports `--version vX.Y.Z` to pin and `--dry-run` to preview.

The notice is suppressed in CI, non-TTY output, dev builds, and when `LLMWIKI_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1` is set.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Ingest a project
llmwiki ingest ~/workspace/my-project

# See what's tracked
llmwiki list

# Feed context to your AI coding session
llmwiki context my-project --inject CLAUDE.md

# Ask questions across all your projects
llmwiki query "which services use gRPC?"

# Generate client-level executive summary
llmwiki index acme

# Update a project's stale README from wiki + memory
llmwiki docs ~/workspace/my-project --write
```

## Features

### Automatic service detection

Point `llmwiki` at a monorepo or multi-service project and it figures out the structure. It reads `docker-compose.yml`, scans for subdirectories with code indicators (`go.mod`, `package.json`, `composer.json`, `Dockerfile`, `pom.xml`, `src/`), and creates one wiki file per service.

### Mermaid diagrams

Every wiki entry includes LLM-generated system architecture diagrams and ERDs. Client-level indexes get C4 system landscape diagrams. All render natively in GitHub, GitLab, and Obsidian.

### Cross-file linking

When a wiki entry mentions another tracked project or service, `llmwiki` automatically creates a markdown link. The result is a navigable knowledge graph — click from the client overview to a project, from a project to a service, from a service to the database it depends on.

### AI coding integration

Inject wiki context directly into `CLAUDE.md` (or any file) with marker-based replacement:

```markdown
<!-- llmwiki:start -->
<!-- llmwiki:end -->
```

```bash
llmwiki context my-project --inject CLAUDE.md
```

Your AI assistant starts every session with Domain, Architecture, Services, and Flows already in context. No more "can you look at the codebase and figure out what this does."

### Incremental refinement

Re-running `ingest` doesn't regenerate from scratch — the LLM sees the previous wiki entry and refines it. Knowledge compounds. Details get richer with each pass.

### Three LLM backends

| Backend | Config | Best for |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Claude Code CLI | `claude-code` (default) | Uses your Claude Code subscription. No API key needed. |
| Claude API | `claude-api` | Fast bulk ingestion. Requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. |
| Ollama | `ollama` | NDA code, air-gapped environments, cost control. |

### Client & project indexes

For consultants and agencies managing multiple clients:

```bash
llmwiki index acme    # executive summary across all acme projects
```

Generates a client-level `_index.md` with executive summary, C4 diagram, architecture overview, and a projects table — useful for onboarding, handoffs, and architecture reviews.

```

Plain markdown with YAML front matter. No proprietary format. Works with git, grep, and any text editor.

## NanoClaw Integration

llmwiki works with [NanoClaw](https://nanoclaw.com) — a Discord bot that can query your wiki knowledge base and answer project questions directly in your Discord server.

![NanoClaw answering a question about llmwiki in Discord](docs/nanoclaw-discord.png)

Ask NanoClaw questions about any of your tracked projects and it draws on the wiki entries llmwiki generated. See [docs/nanoclaw-integration.md](docs/nanoclaw-integration.md) for setup instructions.

## Obsidian Compatibility

![llmwiki graph view in Obsidian](docs/obsidian2.png)

The wiki directory works as an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault out of the box:

1. Open Obsidian, choose "Open folder as vault", select `~/llmwiki/wiki/`
2. Mermaid diagrams render natively in preview mode
3. Cross-file links are clickable — navigate from client to project to service
4. YAML front matter shows as properties
5. Tags are searchable via the tag pane
6. Graph view visualizes your entire knowledge base

## Configuration

### Per-project: `llmwiki.yaml`

```yaml
type: client         # client | personal | oss
customer: acme
llm: ollama          # claude-code | claude-api | ollama
ollama_model: llama3.2
```

### Global: `~/.llmwiki/config.yaml`

```yaml
wiki_root: ~/llmwiki/wiki
llm: claude-code
ollama_host: http://localhost:11434
anthropic_api_key: ""   # or set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY env var
memory_enabled: false   # enable graymatter persistent memory
memory_dir: ~/.llmwiki/memory   # where gray.db lives
```

Per-project config overrides global. If neither exists, defaults to `claude-code` with wiki at `~/llmwiki/wiki/`.

### Memory

Set `memory_enabled: true` in your global config to activate [graymatter](https://github.com/angelnicolasc/graymatter) integration. Memory is stored in a single `gray.db` file at `~/.llmwiki/memory/`. It reuses your existing `anthropic_api_key` for embeddings, and falls back to Ollama or keyword-only search if no key is available.

Seed tribal knowledge that the scanner can't detect:

```bash
llmwiki remember --project my-api "billing service was rewritten from PHP to Go in Q1 2025"
llmwiki remember --project my-api "uses custom auth middleware in pkg/auth, not standard library"
llmwiki recall "which projects use gRPC?"
```

## Automatic Session Capture (Claude Code Hook)

Every time Claude reads your code and explains how something works, that understanding exists only in the conversation — it vanishes when the session ends. The Claude Code hook captures it automatically.

### How it works

llmwiki ships as a Claude Code plugin. After installation, a Stop hook fires at the end of every qualifying turn (assistant response >300 chars with at least one file-reading tool call). It reads the session transcript, extracts the last analytical response, and pipes it to `llmwiki absorb` — storing the insight in graymatter memory with zero user action.

Later, regenerate or update the wiki without re-scanning the codebase:

```bash
llmwiki materialize my-project   # ~5-15K tokens vs 50-100K for full ingest
```

### Install

```bash
# Install the Claude Code plugin
llmwiki hook install

# Check it's active
llmwiki hook status

# Restart Claude Code — the plugin is auto-discovered
```

The plugin is written to `~/.claude/plugins/llmwiki/`. Claude Code detects it on next launch.

To remove:

```bash
llmwiki hook uninstall
```

### Manual install (if you have the repo)

Symlink the bundled plugin directory instead of running the command:

```bash
ln -s /path/to/llmwiki/plugin ~/.claude/plugins/llmwiki
```

### Requirements

- `memory_enabled: true` in `~/.llmwiki/config.yaml`
- `llmwiki` in your `$PATH` (so the hook script can call it)
- Python 3 (used by the hook script; standard on macOS and most Linux distros)

### Lock contention and the absorb queue

If the Stop hook fires while another process holds the memory DB (for example, you have `graymatter tui` open), llmwiki appends the session to a local queue file (`~/.llmwiki/memory/absorb-queue.jsonl` by default). The queue is drained the next time `llmwiki absorb` runs successfully, or explicitly via `llmwiki absorb-drain`.

### Incremental wiki building

The hook + materialize workflow is designed for ongoing sessions where a full `ingest` run would be too expensive. Facts accumulate silently across sessions; you run `materialize` when you want a refreshed wiki entry.

You can also capture explicit insights during a session:

```bash
llmwiki remember --project my-api "retry logic uses exponential back-off with jitter in pkg/retry"
```

## Security

llmwiki v1.0 shipped after a baseline security audit. Highlights:
- Path-traversal rejection on all filesystem-bound inputs
- Fenced + scrubbed LLM prompt/response pipeline
- Loopback-only default for Ollama (SSRF defense)
- Bounded subprocess and HTTP deadlines
- Symlink-TOCTOU refused during directory walks

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the threat model, supported versions, and
how to report a vulnerability. The reproducible CI gate lives in
[.github/workflows/security.yml](.github/workflows/security.yml); run it
locally with `make security-scan`.

## Who This Is For

- **Consultants** juggling 5+ client codebases who can't afford to re-learn each one every Monday
- **Tech leads** who need architecture documentation that actually reflects the code
- **Developers using AI assistants** who are tired of re-explaining project structure every session
- **Teams onboarding new engineers** who want a "read this first" that writes itself
- **Anyone** who has ever thought "I'll document this later" and never did

## Releases

Releases are cut automatically from commit history on `main`:

- **`feat:`** — new feature → minor bump (`0.4.0 → 0.5.0`)
- **`fix:`** — bug fix → patch bump (`0.5.0 → 0.5.1`)
- **`feat!:`** or `BREAKING CHANGE:` in the body → major bump (`0.5.0 → 1.0.0`)
- Anything else (`docs:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`, …) ships silently with the next tagged release.

[release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please) maintains a running "Release PR" that accumulates unreleased commits. Merging that PR creates the git tag and GitHub Release; the release workflow then builds binaries for all four target platforms and attaches them along with `checksums.txt` and `install.sh`.

See all releases: [github.com/emgiezet/llmwiki/releases](https://github.com/emgiezet/llmwiki/releases).
